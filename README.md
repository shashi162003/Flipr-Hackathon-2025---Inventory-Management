## üöÄ Project Setup

To run this project locally, you will need to set up both the backend server and the frontend client.

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file and populate it according to the [Backend README's instructions](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/backend/README.md). 4.  Run the seeder to populate your database with sample data: `npm install bcrypt && node seeder.js -i`
5.  Start the server: `npm run dev` (It will run on `http://localhost:4000` by default)

### 2. Frontend Setup

1.  From the root directory, navigate to the `client` directory: `cd client`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `client` root and add the backend API URL:
    ```dotenv
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
    ```
4.  Start the client: `npm run dev` (It will open in your browser, likely at `http://localhost:5173`)

You can now log in with the seeded user credentials:
-   **Admin Email:** `admin@example.com` | **Password:** `123456`
-   **Staff Email:** `staff@example.com` | **Password:** `123456`
